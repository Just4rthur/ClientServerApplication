This program can be run from MainP2 class, but I created three classes to run the server, the clients and the viewers separately.

Follow these instructions to run the program using 3 different classes (ServerSide, CentralSystem and ClientSide):

1. Run ServerSide to start the servers and the two first viewers (P1Viewer objects).

2. Run CentralSystem to start the MessageClient objects and the rest of the viewers (P2Viewer objects).

3. Run ClientSide to start MessageProducerClient object and send the MessageProducer objects.
